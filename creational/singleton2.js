//Another way of creating a Singleton could be simply creating an object literal with various functions
//and fields. Because objects are not 'instantiated' in JS like other languages, this will also
//work as a Singleton.

singleton = { some_func: function(){ console.log('Hello there!')} ,
			 some_data: {instance: 'dev' , public_key:'AHHHJJJJJJJDDDDHHHH1111'}
